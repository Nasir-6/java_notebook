# Java Notebook

This is a repo containing things I learnt solving problems/learning to code in Java.

It's here for my future self just because I'm bound to forget certain topics and the mistakes I made along my journey.

I realised whilst jumping between languages it's easy to forget concepts, so having my own examples to refer to, alongside some comments will hopefully save my future self from having to re-google/watch/read through resources whenever I become a bit rusty on Java.

Having messed up a coding assessment which forced me to use Java (as JavaScript wasn't available), I wish I had made something like this to refer to as sometimes forgetting things like writing the import statements and using Objects rather than primitives for the keys and values in a Hashmap means you're often solving syntax issues rather than the problem itself. Which is the last thing you want in a timed scenario like that.

Also I'm sure it'll be a useful resource when it comes to teaching others - as the comments will highlight my own misconceptions and the points which made everything click for me when I was learning a concept/banging my head in agony.
