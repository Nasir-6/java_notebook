    // DP aims to optimise solutions by storing and using intermediate solutions (so no need to recompute) - works well with repetitive algorithms

    // Tips for solving DP problems
    // 1) First solve recursively
    // 2) Memoize - Store intermediate solutions and use them
    // Do this by spotting any patterns where results are recalculated - to cut down any unnecessary computations
    // 3) Bottom Up approach - If you don't like Recursion - start from the base case and use a for loop to work up to the solution
